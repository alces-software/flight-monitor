The idea is to use one of the nodes as the “monitor” instance, the gateway instance already uses a MariaDB database, so various things would need to change, so advised to use one of the nodes for this purpose.

1. Start an OpenFlightHPC cluster from the “Support Build Hub” centos@54.246.245.163 
2. Log in to cluster and run flight start to ensure keys are copied about.
3. Log into the node you intend to repurpose as your monitor instance
4. Switch to root
5. Run curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alces-software/flight-monitor/master/build/fcm-setup_cloud.sh | /bin/bash
6. Allow installation to complete.
7. Once complete run the VPN installation script as instructed by the monitor setup script /tmp/fcm-vpnclient and enter the user&pass for your cluster. 
8. Once VPN installation complete run the webserver installation as instructed by the script /tmp/fcm-webserver.sh
9. Edit /etc/hostname to change machine hostname to monitor1.<fqdn> 
10. Log in to AWS Route53 console, find your cluster domain, and edit the name of the node you have repurposed to resolve to monitor1
11. Restart the node
12. Ensure services have all started (you will need to manually enable and start zabbix-proxy and zabbix-agent 
13. You can then execute curl http://monitor1/resources/install_agent.sh | /bin/bash on any other instance within the cluster to start the agent
